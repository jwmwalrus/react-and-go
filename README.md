React And Go
============

Proof-of-concept for using a React frontend alongside a Go backend.

It uses the project built during a course on the matter, as a starting point.

The root directory is the whole backend, with the frontend contained in the `web` subfolder.

Improvements after the course:

* Handle .env files
* Remove secrets and apikeys from the code
* Use camelCase in JSON annotations
* Add airbnb style rules to ESLint (mostly)
* Add editorconfig file
* Add better versioning with bumpy-ride
